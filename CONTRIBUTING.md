## Suggested Workflow for an Effective Development Process ðŸš€

This guideline enable the team to collaboratively build a robust, user-centered software product while upholding high technical and product standards.

### 1. **Start with a New Issue**

Kick off your contribution by creating a new issue in the repository's issue tracker. Use GitHub issues for tracking bugs and requesting features. Ensure your description is clear and detailed to make it easier for others to understand the issue, reproduce bugs, or implement features. For more guidance on creating issues, refer to the [GitHub Issues Quickstart Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#:~:text=Opening%20a%20blank%20issue%201%20On%20GitHub.com%2C%20navigate,uses%20issue%20templates%2C%20click%20Open%20a%20blank%20issue).

### 2. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.example.com/{your_project}.git
```

### 3. **Setting Up Your Development Environment**:

> Update the Environment Configuration:

**Modify `environment.yaml` File**:
   - Locate `environment.yaml` in the repository.
   - Change the `name` field to a preferred name for your Conda environment, as shown below:

     ```yaml
     name: my-template-environment
     channels:
         - conda-forge
         - defaults
     dependencies:
         - python=3.10
         - pip
         - pip:
             - -r requirements.txt
             - -r requirements-codequality.txt
     ```

**Edit `requirements.txt`**:
   - This file should contain all essential packages for your code in the `src` directory.
   - Ensure each dependency is listed with its correct version.

**Edit `requirements-codequality.txt`**:
   - Include packages for code quality checks and CI processes.
   - Add tools for linting, formatting, and other code quality assurance measures.

> **Note**: Continuously update these files as new packages are integrated into your project.

#### Creating and Activating the Conda Environment:

> **For Windows Users**

1. **Create the Conda Environment**:
   - Open your terminal or command line and navigate to the repository directory.
   - Use the command below to create the Conda environment from `environment.yaml`:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yaml
     ```
   - This command sets up the Conda environment as defined in `environment.yaml`.

2. **Activate the Environment**:
   - Once created, activate it using:
     ```bash
     conda activate vector-indexing-azureaisearch
     ```

> **For Linux Users (or Windows with WSL/Linux setup)**

1. **Use `make` for Environment Setup**:
   - In your terminal, go to the repository directory.
   - Use the `make` command from the Makefile to create the Conda environment:
     ```bash
     make create_conda_env
     ```

2. **Activate the Environment**:
   - After creation, activate the new Conda environment with:
     ```bash
     conda activate vector-indexing-azureaisearch
     ```

This procedure prepares your development environment with the necessary Python version and installs all required packages as per your `requirements.txt` and `requirements-codequality.txt`.

### 4. **Create a New Branch for Features or Bug Fixes**:

Always create a new branch for your work, branching off from the `staging` branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch that indicates whether it's a new feature or a bug fix. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName_or_bugfix/YourBugFixName
```
#### Branching Strategy Visualized

![Branching Strategy Diagram](utils/images/flow.png)

**Explanation**:
- `feature/new_feature branch` is for development.
- `staging branch` is for the staging environment, where code is further tested and validated.
- `main branch` is the production environment with the

### 5. **Incorporate Tests and Update Documentation as Necessary**:

- **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for any new code you write. These tests should be small, isolated, and test a single function or method. They should be located in the `tests` directory, in a file that mirrors the file structure of the code being tested. For example, tests for `src/my_module.py` should be in `tests/test_my_module.py`.

- **Integration Tests**: If you're adding a feature that involves multiple components interacting, consider adding an integration test. These tests should be located in the `tests/integration` directory.

- **Documentation**: Update the project's documentation to reflect any changes you've made. If you've added a new function or method, add a docstring that describes what it does, its parameters, and its return value. If you've added a new feature, update the README or other relevant documentation files to describe how to use it.


### 6. **Run test suite and style checks to ensure integrity**

> Note: The `make` command is primarily used in Unix-based systems (like Linux and MacOS) for automating tasks. If you're using Windows, you might not have `make` available. However, you can still perform the tasks by running the individual commands that are defined in the `Makefile`. Each `make` command is a series of shell commands that you can run directly in your terminal.

```bash
make run_code_quality_checks
make run_tests
```

### 7. **Update `requirements` as necessary and document any changes in your Pull Request (PR) and `CHANGELOG`.**

### Understanding Version Numbering

- **Major Releases (e.g., 5.0.0)**: Include breaking changes, not backward-compatible with previous versions.
- **Minor Releases (e.g., 5.1.0)**: Introduce new features while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Patch Releases (e.g., 5.1.4)**: Minor fixes or security patches, always backward-compatible.

### 8. **Commit and Push Your Changes**:

Use descriptive commit messages that follow a standard format. This helps other contributors understand your changes. The format is 'TypeOfChange: Brief description of the change'. Then, push your changes to your branch on the remote repository.

```bash
git commit -m 'TypeOfChange: Brief description of the change'
git push origin YourBranchName
```

### 9. **Create Well-Documented Pull Requests**

- Open a pull request (PR) targeting either the `staging` or `main` branch. Fill in the PR template with clear and detailed instructions about the changes you've made. This should include the purpose of the changes, the approach you took, any dependencies that should be noted, and any testing that was done.

- Upon submission, a GitHub CI pipeline will automatically trigger. This pipeline will run any tests and checks defined in the repository. Make sure to monitor the results and fix any issues that arise.

- Engage in the review process. Respond to any comments or requests for changes from the reviewers. This is a collaborative process and your responses are important.

- Once the PR is approved, it will be merged into the target branch by the developer.

For more information on creating pull requests, refer to this [GitHub documentation on pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Additional Setup Steps (Optional)

### Setting Up VSCode for Jupyter Notebooks

a. **Install Required Extensions**: Download and install the `Python` and `Jupyter` extensions for VSCode. These extensions provide support for running and editing Jupyter Notebooks within VSCode.

b. **Open the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`01-indexing-content.ipynb`) in VSCode.

c. **Attach Kernel to VSCode**: After creating the Conda environment, it should be available in the kernel selection dropdown. This dropdown is located in the top-right corner of the VSCode interface. Select your newly created environment (`vector-indexing-azureaisearch`) from the dropdown. This sets it as the kernel for running your Jupyter Notebooks.

d. **Run the Notebook**: Once the kernel is attached, you can run the notebook by clicking on the "Run All" button in the top menu, or by running each cell individually.

### Configuring Pre-commit Hooks

a. **Setup Hooks for Code Quality Assurance**: Run the following command to set up various hooks to ensure code quality, including `flake8`, `mypy`, `isort`, `black`, `check-yaml`, `end-of-file-fixer`, and `trailing-whitespace`.

```bash
make set_up_precommit_and_prepush
```

## Development Tips

This section provides guidance for the development phase of the Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC). It focuses on the iterative cycle between development and testing, crucial for identifying and resolving issues during the early stages of software development.

### Benefits of Committing to Testing Early

Committing to testing early in the development process, even during fast, iterative cycles, offers several advantages:
- Quick identification and resolution of bugs and defects.
- Improved code reliability and maintainability.
- Enhanced understanding of the code's behavior and performance.

### Utilizing Jupyter Notebooks with %%ipytest for Interactive Testing

For rapid development and testing, Jupyter Notebooks offer a convenient and interactive environment. Hereâ€™s a practical trick for fast development using Jupyter Notebooks:

1. Write your function within a Jupyter Notebook cell.
2. Use the `%%ipytest` magic command to quickly test the function within the notebook environment.

Suppose you are developing a function `add_numbers`:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    This function adds two numbers.

    Parameters:
    a (int or float): The first number.
    b (int or float): The second number.

    Returns:
    int or float: The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b
```
You can quickly test this function using %%ipytest within a Jupyter Notebook cell:

```python

%%ipytest
def test_add_numbers():
    assert add_numbers(1, 2) == 3
    assert add_numbers(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add_numbers(0, 0) == 0
```

> %%ipytest is a cell magic command in Jupyter that allows for running tests in isolation and displaying the results inline, offering immediate feedback. This approach is valuable when building functions incrementally, as it allows for immediate testing and validation. It's particularly useful for testing data transformations and algorithms during the early stages of development.
